### Setting Up Your Local Environment (Optional)

## Contributing Content

### Writing a New Tutorial

To add a new tutorial or blog post:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b add-new-tutorial`
3. Create a new Markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

```yaml
